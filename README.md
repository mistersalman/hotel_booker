# hotel_booker

Introduction:
  This project was created as part of the interview process for LA-based Keypr
  
  When working, it will allow for an admin to set a maximum number of rooms (default 100) and overbooking percentage (default 10)
  When working, it will allow for a user to book a reservation for a day, only if the range is valid and available
  

Context:
  This project uses Python with Django and REST.
  I have a decent understanding of Python, but have never touched the latter two. Most of the time spent on this project is admittedly research
