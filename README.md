# hotel_booker

Introduction:
  This project was created as part of the interview process for LA-based Keypr
  
  When working, it will allow for an admin to set a maximum number of rooms (default 100) and overbooking percentage (default 10)
  When working, it will allow for a user to book a reservation for a day, only if the range is valid and available
  

Context:
  This project uses Python with Django and REST.
  I have a decent understanding of Python, but have never touched the latter two. Most of the time spent on this project is admittedly research
  

How to Run:
  My settings:
    I designed this project in PyCharm in order to minimize issues with preparing a virtual environment for Django. I highly encourage you do the same.
    The application, as is, should be able to run out of the box. 'Run' the program and you will be directed to an admin login.
    Here, enter testAdmin as the login and password12 as the password. This will give you superuser access.
